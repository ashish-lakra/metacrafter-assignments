# Polygon zkSNARK Circuit Implementation
In this project, we will design a zkSNARK circuit using the Circom programming language to implement the following logical gate:

- Logic Gate: The goal is to prove that you know the inputs A (0) and B (1) that yield a 0 output.

We will use the hardhat-circom template to write the circuit, compile it to generate circuit intermediaries, and then generate a proof using the given inputs A=0 and B=1. Additionally, we will deploy a solidity verifier contract to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet and verify the proof on-chain.

## Tools Used

For this project, we will use the following tools:

- Circom: A programming language for zkSNARK circuit design.
- Hardhat-Circom: A template for writing Circom circuits and compiling them with Hardhat.
- Hardhat: A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.

## Description

The `PolygonCircuit` is a circuit template implemented in pragma circom 2.0.0. It consists of an AND gate, a NOT gate, and an OR gate that are interconnected to form a logical circuit. The circuit takes two input signals `a` and `b`, and produces a single output signal `q` based on the following logic:

1. `a` and `b` are fed into an AND gate to produce an intermediate signal `x`.
2. `b` is fed into a NOT gate to produce an intermediate signal `y`.
3. `x` and `y` are then fed into an OR gate to produce the final output signal `q`.

The circuit essentially implements the following expression:

```
q = (a AND b) OR NOT(b)
```

## Gate Templates

The circuit utilizes the following gate templates:

### AND Gate

The AND gate is responsible for performing the logical AND operation on its two input signals `a` and `b`. The output `out` is 1 if both inputs are 1; otherwise, it is 0.

### OR Gate

The OR gate performs the logical OR operation on its two input signals `a` and `b`. The output `out` is 1 if at least one input is 1; otherwise, it is 0.

### NOT Gate

The NOT gate is responsible for negating its input signal `in`. The output `out` is 1 if the input is 0, and 0 if the input is 1.

## Usage

To use the `PolygonCircuit`, you need to instantiate the `main` component, and then provide appropriate input signals `a` and `b`. The output signal `q` will be generated according to the circuit's logic.

Example usage in circom code:

```circom
component main = PolygonCircuit();

signal input a;
signal input b;

main.a <== a;
main.b <== b;

// Access the output signal 'q'
signal output q = main.q;
```
## Steps to Complete the Project

1. **Write the Circuit**: We will start by implementing the zkSNARK circuit using Circom. The circuit will implement the specified logical gate and will have input signals A and B, as well as an output signal.

2. **Compile the Circuit**: Once the circuit implementation is complete, we will use Hardhat-Circom to compile the circuit, which will generate the necessary circuit intermediaries.

3. **Generate a Proof**: With the compiled circuit and the specified inputs A=0 and B=1, we will generate a proof that proves our knowledge of the inputs that yield a 0 output.

4. **Deploy the Verifier Contract**: Next, we will deploy a solidity verifier contract to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet. This verifier contract will be responsible for verifying the proofs generated by the circuit.

5. **Verify the Proof on-chain**: After deploying the verifier contract, we will call the `verifyProof()` method on the contract, passing the generated proof as input. We will then assert that the output of the method is true, indicating successful proof verification.

## Circuit Implementation

The zkSNARK circuit will be implemented in the `circuit.circom` file. The file will define the logic gate and specify the input and output signals. The intermediate signals will be used to store the outputs of the logical operations.

## How to Use

To run the circuit and generate the proof, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure you have installed Node.js and npm.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Write the circuit logic in the `circuit.circom` file.
5. Compile the circuit using Hardhat-Circom with `npx hardhat circom`.
6. Generate the proof using `npx hardhat generate-proof`.
7. Deploy the verifier contract to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet using `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai`.
8. Verify the proof on-chain by calling the `verifyProof()` method on the deployed verifier contract.
