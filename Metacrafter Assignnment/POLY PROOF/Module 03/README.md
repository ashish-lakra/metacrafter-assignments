# Polygon zkSNARK Circuit Implementation

In this project, we will design a zkSNARK circuit using the Circom programming language to implement the following logical gate:

- Logic Gate: The goal is to prove that you know the inputs A (0) and B (1) that yield a 0 output.

We will use the hardhat-circom template to write the circuit, compile it to generate circuit intermediaries, and then generate a proof using the given inputs A=0 and B=1. Additionally, we will deploy a solidity verifier contract to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet and verify the proof on-chain.

## Tools Used

For this project, we will use the following tools:

- Circom: A programming language for zkSNARK circuit design.
- Hardhat-Circom: A template for writing Circom circuits and compiling them with Hardhat.
- Hardhat: A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.

## Steps to Complete the Project

1. **Write the Circuit**: We will start by implementing the zkSNARK circuit using Circom. The circuit will implement the specified logical gate and will have input signals A and B, as well as an output signal.

2. **Compile the Circuit**: Once the circuit implementation is complete, we will use Hardhat-Circom to compile the circuit, which will generate the necessary circuit intermediaries.

3. **Generate a Proof**: With the compiled circuit and the specified inputs A=0 and B=1, we will generate a proof that proves our knowledge of the inputs that yield a 0 output.

4. **Deploy the Verifier Contract**: Next, we will deploy a solidity verifier contract to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet. This verifier contract will be responsible for verifying the proofs generated by the circuit.

5. **Verify the Proof on-chain**: After deploying the verifier contract, we will call the `verifyProof()` method on the contract, passing the generated proof as input. We will then assert that the output of the method is true, indicating successful proof verification.

## Circuit Implementation

The zkSNARK circuit will be implemented in the `circuit.circom` file. The file will define the logic gate and specify the input and output signals. The intermediate signals will be used to store the outputs of the logical operations.

## How to Use

To run the circuit and generate the proof, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure you have installed Node.js and npm.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Write the circuit logic in the `circuit.circom` file.
5. Compile the circuit using Hardhat-Circom with `npx hardhat circom`.
6. Generate the proof using `npx hardhat generate-proof`.
7. Deploy the verifier contract to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet using `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai`.
8. Verify the proof on-chain by calling the `verifyProof()` method on the deployed verifier contract.
